## Lab-2 (13/12/24)

---

### L21.py

Create a program that takes two numbers as input, adds them, and
prints the result. Ensure they handle cases where the inputs might be
strings (requiring type conversion).

---

### L22.py

Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle using user-
input length and width, and then compare it with the area of a

square with side length half of the rectangle's width.

---

### L23.py

Write a program that takes an integer input, checks if it's even or
odd, and prints a message accordingly. Additionally, use the modulo
operation for this determination.

---

### L24.py

Create a Python program that functions as an advanced calculator. It
should take user input for mathematical expressions and evaluate
them, supporting basic operations, parentheses, and scientific
notation.

---

### L25.py

Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a
specified number of terms. Use a while loop and branching to
implement the logic.

---

### L26.py

Create a program that takes user input and checks whether the
entered number is a prime number or not. Utilize a for loop and
branching statements.

## Lab-3 (20/12/24)

### L31.py

Password Validator: Develop a Python function to validate a user&#39;s password. The
function should check for minimum length, presence of uppercase and lowercase
letters, at least one digit, and a special character. If the password is valid, return
True, otherwise return False and display an informative error message.

---

### L32.py

Area Calculator: Write a Python function that calculates the area of different shapes
(triangle, square, rectangle, and circle). The function should accept the necessary
dimensions as arguments and return the corresponding area.

---

### L33.py

Write a program that takes an array of numbers and returns the second largest
element in the array.

---

### L34.py

Write a program that takes a list of words and returns a dictionary that maps each
word to its frequency in the list.

---

### L35.py

Write a Python program that takes two sets of integers as input and returns a new set
containing all the elements that are common to both sets, but the common elements
should be raised to the power of 2.

---

### L36.py

Write a Python code to rotate a given 2D square matrix (NxN) by 90 degrees
clockwise in-place. The function should modify the original matrix and return the
modified matrix.

---

### L37.py

Given a list of integers, write a Python program to find the longest increasing
subsequence. The function should return the length of the subsequence and the
subsequence itself. Ensure that the subsequence is a continuous subsequence (not
necessarily unique).

### L41.py

WAP that removes all duplicate elements from a list without using set() and
preserves the original order.

---

### L42.py

WAP to rotate a list to the right by k positions, where k is an integer provided as input
using list.

---

### L43.py

Given a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are lists of
scores, WAP to calculate the average score for each student and return it as a
dictionary.

---

### L44.py

WAP to count the frequency of each character in a given string and store the result in
a dictionary.

---

### L45.py

WAP to find the first non-repeating character in a string. If all characters repeat,
return “None”.

---

### L46.py

WAP that takes a dictionary where keys are employee names and values are their
respective salaries. Return the top 3 employees with the highest salaries in
descending order. If there are ties, sort by name alphabetically.

---

### L47.py

WAP to find the longest substring of a given string where all characters are unique.
Return both the substring and its length.

### L51.py

• Objective: Implement BFS and DFS to solve a maze.
Problem Statement: Given a grid-based maze where 0 represents walls and 1 represents walkable paths, find the
shortest path from a start cell to an end cell.
• Tasks:
1. Use BFS to find the shortest path.
2. Use DFS to explore all possible paths and report one valid path (not necessarily the shortest).
3. Compare the number of nodes explored by BFS and DFS.

### L71.py

Maze Solver using BFS, DFS, and IDDFS
• Objective: Implement IDDFS to solve a maze.
Problem Statement: Given a grid-based maze where 0 represents walls and 1
represents walkable paths, find the shortest path from a start cell to an end
cell.
• Tasks:
1. Use IDDFS to find the shortest path.
2. Compare the number of nodes explored by BFS, DFS, and IDDFS.
3. Take the same example graph and give a conclusion in your own words on which algorithm is best and why.

Problem Statement: Given a weighted graph (e.g., a transportation network with travel costs), find the minimum-cost path between two nodes.
• Tasks:
1. Represent the graph as an adjacency list.
2. Implement Uniform Cost Search to find the optimal path.

A* Search for a Puzzle Solver
• Objective: Solve the 8-puzzle using A* search.
Problem Statement: The 8-puzzle involves sliding tiles to achieve a goal state.
Use A* to solve it.
• Tasks:
Define heuristic functions:
1. H1: Number of misplaced tiles.
2. H2: Sum of Manhattan distances of all tiles from their goal positions.
3. Implement A* with both heuristics.
4. Compare the performance of the two heuristics in terms of the number of nodes explored and solution depth.
